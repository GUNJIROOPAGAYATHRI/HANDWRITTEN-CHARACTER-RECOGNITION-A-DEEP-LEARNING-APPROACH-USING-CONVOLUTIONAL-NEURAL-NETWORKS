# Handwritten Character Recognition: A Deep Learning Approach using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

This project implements a **Handwritten Character Recognition** system using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**. The model is designed to recognize and classify handwritten characters (such as digits or letters) from images. It leverages deep learning techniques to automatically extract features from images and accurately predict the corresponding character.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview  

The goal of this project is to develop a robust character recognition system capable of identifying handwritten characters, including letters and digits. The system uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to process the images and make predictions based on trained data. This project also focuses on optimizing the model for better accuracy and performance on unseen handwritten data.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Files  

The project contains the following Python files:  

- **app.py**: The main Python file that serves as the web interface for uploading images and displaying predictions. It integrates the trained model and handles user interactions.
- **model.py**: Contains the definition and architecture of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. It is used to train the model and predict characters from images.

## ðŸ”§ Functionality  

1. **User Input:**
   - The user uploads an image of handwritten text (a character or digit) via the interface in `app.py`.

2. **Image Processing:**
   - The uploaded image is preprocessed, resized, and normalized to meet the input requirements of the trained model.

3. **Model Prediction:**
   - The CNN model, defined in `model.py`, processes the image and outputs the predicted character based on the trained dataset.

4. **Result Display:**
   - The predicted character is displayed on the interface, along with the confidence level of the prediction.

## ðŸ§  Model Architecture  

The CNN used in this project is designed to process 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten characters. The model architecture consists of the following layers:

1. **Convolutional Layer:** Extracts features using multiple filters (e.g., 32 filters of size 3x3).
2. **Max Pooling Layer:** Reduces the spatial dimensions of feature maps.
3. **Flatten Layer:** Converts the 2D feature maps into a 1D vector for classification.
4. **Fully Connected Layer:** The vector is passed through a dense layer (e.g., 128 neurons).
5. **Output Layer:** Softmax activation is used for multi-class classification to predict the character.

```bash
python model.py
